### Cooking Recipe

![Salted Butter Chocolate Chunk Shortbread](https://smittenkitchendotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/salted-butter-chocolate-chunk-shortbread.jpg?w=1500)

Ingredients:

-   1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (9 ounces or 255 grams) salted butter, cold, cut into small pieces
-   1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
-   1/4 cup (50 grams) light brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract
-   2 1/4 cups (295 grams) all-purpose flour
-   6 ounces (170 grams) semi- or bittersweet dark chocolate, chopped (you want chunks, not thin shards of chocolate)
-   1 large egg
-   Demerara, turbinado, raw, or sanding sugar, for rolling
-   Flaky sea salt for sprinkling

Kitchen Tools Needed:

-   electric mixer
-   parchment paper, waxed paper or plastic wrap
-   baking oven
-   baking sheets

Steps:

1.  Beat the butter, granulated and brown sugars, and vanilla with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, scraping down bowl as needed.

2.  Add flour, and mix just until combined.

3.  Add chocolate chunks, mix just until incorporated.

4.  Divide between two sheets of parchment paper, waxed paper, or plastic wrap and use your hands to form the dough halves into log shapes about 2 to 2 1/4 inches in diameter.

5.  Chill until totally firm, about 2 hours.

6.  Heat your oven to 350°F. Line one or two large baking sheets with parchment paper.

7.  Lightly beat the egg and open up your chilled cookies logs to brush it over the sides.

8.  Sprinkle the coarse sugar on the open paper or plastic wrap and roll the logs into it, coating them.

9.  Using a sharp serrated knife, cut logs into 1/2-inch thick rounds.

10. Arrange cookie slices on prepared sheets one inch apart (they don’t spread much) and sprinkle each with a few flakes of salt.

11. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to get golden brown.

12. Let cool slightly before transferring to the cookies.

There isn't a specific season for this recipe. The gredients are accessible throughout the year. The weather/temperature could cause some variations on baking or refrigerating time though.

The recipe works perfectly also with 250 grams of butter, which is the mass of a normal block, instead of 255 grams.

### Euclidean Distance

**Definition** \[Edit\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean Distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $\\overline{\\mathbf{p}\\mathbf{q}}$.

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$
$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$\\|\\mathbf{p}\\| = \\sqrt{p\_{1}^{2} + p\_{2}^{2} + \\dots + p\_{n}^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}}$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
